 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Completed a code proof to certify the correctness of a highly
   optimised assembly language program.
 \item Contributed to a timing analysis of this program, to ensure the
   avoidance of race conditions.
 \item Studied the potential use of the TLAPS theorem prover for
   distributed systems, and created some preliminary internal
   documentation.
 \end{itemize}

 {\bf Research Intern} at Apple Computer, Inc., Austin, TX, USA. \hfill (2017)
